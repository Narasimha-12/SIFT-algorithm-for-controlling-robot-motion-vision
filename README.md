# SIFT-algorithm-for-controlling-robot-motion-vision
Scale-invariant feature transform has many applications in our daily life. The main feature in the working principle of SIFT algorithm is to find the key points in an image by transforming an image into scale-invariant and rotation-invariant. By using this key points, the algorithm will compare the images and declare whether the images are of same or not.
I had understood about the implementation of SIFT algorithm for gesture recognition for controlling a robot motion vision. For tranfering our thoughts and views in any situation, than using words gestures will say about the intent of speakear in an efficient way. So, to control a robot with our gestures is very easy. So, I had used this SIFT algorithm to make a robot understand about the intention of the speaker through the person gesture, how the robot will compare the present gesture with the database trained to it.
